    <h1> Basic Web Development</h1>

    Welcome to my basic web! I created this website as I 
    learned how to make websites. I am currently learning 
    from cs50x 2024. I simply add what I think would be worth 
    keeping notes of. I am not very consistent so you might see
    lots of basic stuff here that you might feel unneccesary to
    take notes of, but it'll be easy for me to quickly get back 
    after being away for a while.
